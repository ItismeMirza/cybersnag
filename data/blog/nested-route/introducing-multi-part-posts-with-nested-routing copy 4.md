# Amazon Interview

Reader, if you have come across this post, it implies you are curious about my recent interview failure at Amazon. Please understand, i am not writing this
to bring about self-pity; rather, i am posting my understaning of the experience to document and to share insight into the interview i had attended.

## Why did you interview at Amazon?

Let me spare you with the prettier answer, I wanted to interview for Amazon, becuase who would not want to work at Amazon. The pay is high, the status is high, and the work seems meaningful. Orignally, the way i went about answering this question, read outloud, to be a huge cope. Now, i could rationalize my interest to make the conjecture that I applied for this role, becuase i deserved this role. However, although my feelings tell me that this was meant to be, the bitter reality was very different. Some cool notes about the role, it had to do with Space Tech (broadband sattelites). Now this post is not a study about Amazons current investments or about my personal feelings after recieving a rejection. Rather, i'd like to share the interviews format, questions asked and my reflection of my performance.

## Tell me the Deets!

Before i begin sharing - I'd just like to point out, it has been years since ive written with my own voice. I have been spoiled with chatgpt, and to my suprise, i feel like ive almost forgotten how to write.

## Recuiter Reached out

Now it should be no suprise, i was the one who applied for this positon, system Admin. To my suprise, a recuiter had reached out to me, by email, simply asking if I had a green card or if i was a citizen; to which i replied yes. Now, coming from a security focused program, I was excited to know that the recuiter was part of Amazon's security talent team. This means, in my head, im closer to where I'd like to be. To say the least, i was very excited.

I scheduled my interview, and instanlty the fear hit. I believe i am a valuable asset to any team. My years of dedication and hardwork both in acedmia and the market, has bolstered my confidence, yet, i could not shake off the anxiety. FEAR OF FAILURE. For the next couple of days, all i could do is pace. I though to myself, there was no possible way, that i was Amazon material. I did not go to a prestigous college and i have not contributed significalty to any public project.

## Fear of Failure

Funnily, as i read through my thoughts, this post has shaped into the exact opposite of my intention - this is a insight into my rejection, and how i plan to handle it. Now long story short, i gave the interview. There were moments where i beleived that, perhaps, it woudl be better for me, if i declined to interview, and wait until i feel more prepared. However, I kept on. To prepare, i was under the suggestion to practice my coding skills. Oh, how that was wrong. See, if you go anywhere on reddit or google, people are constantly talking about Amazon's coding challenges. I was under the impression, that I would not be tested on system Admin skills, as it relates to online applications, but rather, i would be tested to see if I could reverse a linked list.
