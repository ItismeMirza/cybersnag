# Where Have I been?

Reader, if you're wondering where I’ve been, rest assured—I’m back!

I started my tech journey at a very high level of abstraction—just like most people. I vividly remember figuring out how disks work, simply because I couldn't always get Lego Star Wars to run on my original Xbox. I remember trying to connect my DS to my router just so I could trade Pokémon—rest assured, I learned some networking in the 2nd grade.

When the iPhone 3GS was a thing, I got into jailbreaking and installing third-party packages—rest assured, I bricked my device multiple times. I could go on and on about my experiences with tech, but the point I want to drive home is this: all tech comes with problems.

My experience solving tech problems has sparked a deep passion for computers. Other than, well, the need to eat, I genuinely enjoy solving problems—especially when they’re built on a set of rules and patterns.

This blog aims to document my journey—the good, the bad, and the ugly. One day, I hope it inspires someone out there to tackle some big problems of their own.
