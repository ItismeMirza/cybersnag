# Why Build a Saas Application?

As I dive deeper into security concepts, I have come to find a strong interest in SaaS solutions. IT security is cool, with its connectwise software and Micorosft tenant migrations, however, with the ever growing amount of most needed solutions; it seems to be the way for me. 

## What is your Stack?

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://nodejs.org/en)

## What is the plan?

While learning basic Web-Pentesting tactics, techniques, and procedures - it is apparent to me that I need to first understand the basic engineering of these
SaaS applications. Although I have very little training with software engineering - my experience with AWS, virutal machines, Linux, and github will be a great start to building out this SaaS application. More to come in the next few days. Thanks for reading!
